# Hypothesis Testing - One and two-sample t-Tests

#Objectives

* Explain the purpose of a t-test and identify applications
* Use a t-test for independence to test for a statistically significant association between two categorical variables
* Use a t-test p-value to draw the correct conclusion about the null and alternative hypothesis

# Hypothesis Testing - Chi square tests

#Objectives

* Objective 01 - explain the purpose of a chi-square test and identify applications
* Objective 02 - set up a chi-square test for independence on two categorical variables
* Objective 03 - use a chi-square test p-value to draw the correct conclusion about the null and alternative hypothesis
* Objective 04 - explain how to compare the null hypothesis and sample and how randomness in the sampling process affect the result

# Module Project: Sampling and Confidence Intervals

#objectives

* Objective 01 - explain the concepts of statistical estimate, precision, and standard error as they apply to inferential statistics
